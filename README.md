House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the buy and sale of real estate using technology.

You are a Data Scientist hired by the company to help you find the best business opportunities in the real estate market. House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.

Your main strategy is to buy good houses in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit.

However, homes have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and location and time of year can also influence prices.
